# Lego Character Design and Animations

This repository contains the design files and animations for a Lego character created using 3ds Max.

## Overview

This project showcases the process of designing a Lego character from scratch using 3ds Max. The character includes detailed body parts such as the body, hips, legs, head, and hands, each created using various techniques within 3ds Max. Additionally, a walking animation has been added to bring the character to life.

## Design Process

- **Body Design**: The body of the character was created using ChamferBox from extended primitives.
- **Hips**: Hips were designed using a standard box for the upper part and a cylinder for the lower part.
- **Legs**: The upper part of the legs was made using a cylinder with extrusion, and the lower part was extended from the cylinder and capped.
- **Head**: The head was designed using Chamfer Cylinder from Extended Primitives and connected to the body by extrusion.
- **Hands**: Hands were created using a cylinder, adjusted using the Taper option and FFD box, and mirrored for symmetry.
- **Finishing Touches**: Unwanted interior components and faces were removed, and textures were added using a texture map to enhance the character's appearance.

## Animation

A walking animation has been added to demonstrate the character's movement. The animation brings the character to life and showcases its design functionality.

## File Structure

- **Design Files**: Contains the 3ds Max files (.max) for each body part.
- **Animations**: Includes the walking animation file.
- **Textures**: Holds the texture map used for adding textures to the character.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the design files and animations to understand the process behind creating a Lego character using 3ds Max. You can also use the files as a reference for your own projects or modify them according to your needs.
